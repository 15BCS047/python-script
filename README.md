# Insert a Tittle for the script//TODO

Hello! Command-line lover, who wants to use the web browser to know how long it will take between two locations when you have this great command-line script to do that? Nobody, right?
Congratulations, you will no longer need to leave your beloved terminal for this.

### What does the script do?
The script calculates the time it will take you to go from location A to location B. You can choose between driving or walking.

### Installing the dependencies
1.Go to the Google API Console.

2.Create or select a project.

3.Click Continue to enable the API and any related services.

4.On the Credentials page, get an API key.
Note: If you have an existing unrestricted API key, or a key with browser restrictions, you may use that key.

5.From the dialog displaying the API key, select Restrict key to set a browser restriction on the API key.

6.In the Key restriction section, select HTTP referrers (web sites), then follow the on-screen instructions to set referrers.

### How to use it
You have to type in the terminal:
 `python Get_travel_time_between_two_location.py`
