# Insert a Tittle for the script//TODO 

Hello! Command-line lover, who wants to use the web browser to know how long it will take between two locations when you have this great command-line script to do that? Nobody, right? 
Congratulations, you will no longer need to leave your beloved terminal for this.

### What does the script do?
The script calculates the time it will take you to go from location A to location B. You can choose between driving or walking.

### Installing the dependencies
//TODO You need install python... explain how to install dependencies like googlemaps Library... how to obtain the google map api key...

### How to use it
You have to type in the terminal:
 `python Get_travel_time_between_two_location.py`
